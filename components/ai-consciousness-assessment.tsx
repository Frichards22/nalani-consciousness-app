Keep cultivating this - it's your superpower."

Every time you override your inner knowing, you're essentially telling the universe 'I don't trust my own guidance.' But gorgeous, your intuition is your direct line to divine intelligence.

Most of us have been conditioned for scarcity, so abundance feels foreign. But here's the secret: you don't need to fix this overnight. Start with smaller amounts. Practice receiving compliments.

The same force that grows flowers and moves planets wants to prosper you. Let it."
